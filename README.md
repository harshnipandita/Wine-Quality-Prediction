# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze various attributes of wine and predict its quality.

Introduction-
The wine quality dataset is publically available on the UCI machine learning repository (Cortez et al., 2009). The dataset has two files, red wine and white wine variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. It contains a large collection of datasets that have been used for the machine learning community. The red wine dataset contains 1599 instances and the white wine dataset contains 4898 instances. Both files contain 11 input features and 1 output feature. Input features are based on the physicochemical tests and output variable based on sensory data is scaled in 11 quality classes from 0 to 10 (0-very bad to 10-very good). Feature selection is the popular data preprocessing step. To build the model it selects the subset of relevant features. According to the weights of the relevance of the features, and with relatively low weighting, features will be removed. This process will simplify the model and reduce the training time, and increase the performance of the model (Panday et al., 2018). We pay attention to feature selection and also the study direction. To evaluate our model, accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score are good indicators to evaluate the performance of the model.
